+ **Theme Options** (Customizes the theme, thanks to Artem Shpynov)
+ **Extra Metadata Loader** (Displays game trailers and logos)
+ **Extra Metadata Fullscreen Mode Helper** (Ensures ExtraMetadata works in fullscreen mode)
+ **Back To Game** (Adds a button to refocus on the game when it loses focus)

4. upload your icon and **Save**
5. Now your platform logo will be displayed in **Fullscreen Mode**

## Show Game Version in Game Details Views

1. Open **Playnite** in **Desktop Mode**
2. Scroll to your game and type **F3** to edit game details
